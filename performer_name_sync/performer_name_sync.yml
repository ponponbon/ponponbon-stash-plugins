name: "Performer Name Sync"
description: >
  Cross-references JavStash and StashDB stash-box endpoints to sync
  performer names and enrich metadata. For every performer with a
  JavStash stash-box ID (regardless of current name language), builds
  a candidate list of Latin names from JavStash aliases, searches
  StashDB with each candidate, renames to the best available Latin
  name, and enriches metadata from StashDB when a match is found.
